  <p style="font-size: 1.5vw; padding: 5vw;">This is my prized wall of old(er) games.  I personally love the old jewl cases of the PlayStation 1 games 
    because I was so used to the DVD cases used by the Wii and PS2 games.  I have beat a majority of these games, 
    but mostly in high school because I've been too busy at college.

  <p style="font-size: 1.5vw; padding: 5vw;">I bought my own PS2 before my uncle gave me his, but the one I bought didn't output the color red and his
    had a faulty disc drive.  I was able to switch the disc drives and changed the disc reader, and it worked for a while,
    but it didn't play PlayStation 1 games for some reason, so I just bought the white one and it still works well.
